**Things that I practiced with this project:**
+ Creating forms and using input from them in other placefs
+ Passing an array into a function as its parameters using spread syntax
+ Prototypal inheritance / new object creation

**Other thoughts:**
+ I had some issues with the formatting in this project. For example, I would like the box around the books to grow as the page changes size, but for the book cards to stay left aligned within that box. 

**Next steps:**
+ I really like to read, so it would be nice to keep working on this project and then use it to keep track of what I'm reading. I'd like to be able to click on each card and have it expand and allow for more detailed notes on each book. I'd also like to be able to use the buttons on the bottom ('read','currently reading','not yet read') to toggle between states, and also filter by other user-generated categories such as the gender of the author or fiction versus non-fiction, etc.
